# TheImpossibleGame
My project involves all four arrow keys(up, down, left, right). In short, the up arrow moves up, the down arrow moves down, the left arrow moves left, and the right arrow moves right. Using these directional arrow keys, you have to avoid the basketballs, and reach the bell to score a point.
